# BookSnatcher
this is another vibe coded python script to host a flask site. Can you guess what it does?


# Usage
  Spin up the server (BookSnatcher.py) and visit it at :5000 on a kindle or PC. 
  
  put books in your books dir if you want them to be downloadable, do keep in mind only .MOBI, .AZW, .AZW3 or .PRC files will be able to do direct download.

  Go to settings in the web UI, set your rapi-dapi (rapidapi.com) stuff in there. you will need to sign up there (free) and add bookdiscovery and annas-archive-api keys to the settings to do anything other than serve yourself .MOBI/.AZW. Set up all your other settings like SMTP to email books. Make sure you added the email you use to your accepted senders on the kindle email, or it will never work!
